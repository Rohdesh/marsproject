I made three circuit projects here in the tinkercad using the following sensors-
1. Flex sensor and push button
2. gas sensor and temperature sensor
3. force sensor and tilt sensor

project 1 - flex Sensor and push button:
   I watched all the videos provided by the mars club on task#1 discription.From there I got so much of idea about how to do this task.
In this task i just applied basic sensor knowledge and used flex sensor for tracking the bending of 
the  strip of the sensor. flex sensors are interesting sensors and they have wide range of application such as in robotic arms and etc. 
Simulates a game controller: bending the glove (flex sensor) moves a servo, and push button triggers an action. Displays values on the serial monitor.


project 2 - Gas sensor and Temperature sensor:
while searching about the Gas sensor i got to know that this sensor sences the concentration and presence of gas and according to that
it changes the potential diffenrence.thus we can detect the presence of gas in the atmosphere.
Temperature sensor actually measures the temperature and detects it on the screen. for getting the output i used the LED and piezo
so that i can get the alarms if the reading  goes beyond the fixed limits in the code.

project 3 - Force sensor and Tilt sensor
force sensor besically measures the amount of pressure force so wanted to use that and i used another tilt sensor with that as we  
needed minimum of 2 sensors in each projectalso for this for getting the output responces i used piezo and a LED. here i learned
the two codes seperatly and then finally combined the both codes. and surprisingly it worked.

I made three circuit projects here in the tinkercad using the following sensors-
1. Ultrasonic distance sensor
2. gas sensor and temperature sensor
3. force sensor and tilt sensor

project 1 - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor:
   I watched all the videos provided by the mars club on task#1 discription.From there I got so much of idea about how to do this task.
In this task as it was my first try so i just applies simple sensor knowledge and used ultrasonic sensor for tracking the distance of 
the obstacle in the range of the sensor.As we are going to deal with mars rover so I thought it will be useful for that purpose.
Now for the coding i watched so many videos for how to code for the particular sensor. Thats how this circuit was made.


project 2 - Gas sensor and Temperature sensor:
while searching about the Gas sensor i got to know that this sensor sences the concentration and presence of gas and according to that
it changes the potential diffenrence.thus we can detect the presence of gas in the atmosphere.
Temperature sensor actually measures the temperature and detects it on the screen. for getting the output i used the LED and piezo
so that i can get the alarms if the reading  goes beyond the fixed limits in the code.

project 3 - Force sensor and Tilt sensor
force sensor besically measures the amount of pressure force so wanted to use that and i used another tilt sensor with that as we  
needed minimum of 2 sensors in each projectalso for this for getting the output responces i used piezo and a LED. here i learned
the two codes seperatly and then finally combined the both codes. and surprisingly it worked.
